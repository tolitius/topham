# topham

> "top ‚û°Ô∏è down" [hamming weights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)

* record information with its dimensions
* enrich it with "`topham`": _ordered_ hamming weight bits
* given an arbitrary set of dimensions, find the best match

## what is it

**topham matching** is a selection strategy for multi dimensional data, where each row represents a partially defined configuration.
some dimensions may be missing, and a corresponding bitmask (called `topham`) encodes which fields are present.

partial dimensions are searched by queries that specify values for any/some key dimensions, and a piece of data is considered a **match** if it maximizes the presence of available dimensions: priority first, hamming weight second.

### matching how ‚ú®

among all matching candidates, topham prioritizes:

 * **alignment first**: a row must match the order/priority as well as a maximum number of dimensions (compared to other rows) that _are in a query_
 * **specificity second**: among matches, the row with the most defined fields (i.e., the highest **hamming weight** in its `topham` bitmask) is selected

this top down, specificity aware approach is ideal for configuration resolution, rule engines, or any system where layered overrides and dimensional fallbacks are needed.

### example: find a spacecraft üõ∏

ships has been assigned to missions across the galaxy using dimensions: galaxy, star, planet, moon, and asteroid.

| galaxy      | star       | planet     | moon      | asteroid     | mission type | `topham` | ship              |
|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| Outer Rim   | Tatoo I    | Tatooine   | -         | -            | Patrol       | 11100    | **Millennium Falcon** |
| Outer Rim   | Tatoo I    | -          | Jedha     | -            | Patrol       | 11010    | **Ghost**             |
| Outer Rim   | -          | Tatooine   | -         | Polis Massa  | Patrol       | 10101    | **Slave I**           |
| -           | Tatoo I    | Tatooine   | -         | -            | Patrol       | 01100    | **X-Wing**            |
| -           | -          | Tatooine   | -         | -            | Patrol       | 00100    | **Starfighter**       |
| Core        | -          | -          | Endor     | -            | Patrol       | 10010    | **Y-Wing**            |
| Core        | -          | -          | -         | -            | Patrol       | 10000    | **TIE Fighter**       |

üß≠ looking for a closest known ship:

```clojure
{:galaxy "Outer Rim" :star "Tatoo I" :planet "Tatooine"}
```
it matches:
| galaxy      | star       | planet     | moon      | asteroid     | mission type | `topham` | ship              |
|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| Outer Rim   | Tatoo I    | Tatooine   | -         | -            | Patrol       | 11100    | **Millennium Falcon** |
| -           | Tatoo I    | Tatooine   | -         | -            | Patrol       | 01100    | **X-Wing**            |
| -           | -          | Tatooine   | -         | -            | Patrol       | 00100    | **Starfighter**       |

* selected ship: **Millennium Falcon**
* since it has the highest "presence" (topham = `11110`)
* _all_ its defined fields match the query

but, what if we don't know the planet?

```clojure
{:galaxy "Core" :star "Alderaan" :moon "Endor"}
```
it matches both:
| galaxy      | star       | planet     | moon      | asteroid     | mission type | `topham` | ship              |
|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| Core        | -          | -          | Endor     | -            | Patrol       | 10010    | **Y-Wing**            |
| Core        | -          | -          | -         | -            | Patrol       | 10000    | **TIE Fighter**       |

* selected ship: **Y-Wing** (closest known ship)
* since has the highest "presence" (topham = `10010`)
* _some_ its defined fields match the query
* e.g. out of all the candidates, it has the most defined (2) matching dimensions

from this examples you can see that "`-`" ("null"/"nothing" in the database) serves as a `wildcard`

wildcards are used two ways:

* when searching for a value that does not exist in the database
* when matching a column value that is not given in the query

in this next example
both a "moon" and an "asteroid" are not given in a query, and hence would match a "nothing" value (a wildcard)<br/>
a star is given, but is not present in the database, and hence a wildcard is used:

```clojure
{:galaxy "Core" :star "Alderaan"}
```
it only matches:
| galaxy      | star       | planet     | moon      | asteroid     | mission type | `topham` | ship              |
|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| Core        | -          | -          | -         | -            | Patrol       | 10000    | **TIE Fighter**       |

* selected ship: **TIE Fighter** (closest known ship)
* since this is the only row with matching galaxy and wildcards for star, moon and asteroid
* _some_ its defined fields match the query
* its topham / "presence" is `10000`
* and out of all the candidates, it has the most defined (1) matching dimensions
